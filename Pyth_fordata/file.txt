For the 2021-2022 academic year, IRB Barcelona is offering up to 20 PhD fellowships for young scientists from the national and international community who wish to undertake a doctoral degree in biomedicine. We encourage applications from highly motivated graduates with outstanding qualifications in biology, biochemistry, physics, pharmacology, computational biology or related fields. Successful candidates will join research groups headed by top-level scientists and will carry out their research in cutting-edge fields of biomedicine in a stimulating environment.
This project opportunity is offered as part of the Queen's Doctoral Training Programme - Multi-dimensional approaches to understanding microbe/host interactions in the context of disease, therapeutics and community resilience.

Viruses are the most numerous and most diverse form of life on Earth, present in virtually all environments. The majority of viruses are bacterial viruses, or bacteriophages. Bacteriophages can transfer genes between bacteria, including virulence factors, metabolic genes, and antibiotic resistance determinants. The extent and relevance of antibiotic resistance transmission by bacteriophages is still poorly understood. While antibiotic resistance genes are routinely detected in various viromes, the overall antimicrobial resistance potential of environmental phages remains a controversial topic.
